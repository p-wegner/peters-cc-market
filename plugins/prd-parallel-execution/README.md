# PRD Parallel Execution Plugin

This plugin provides a complete system for converting Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into contract-first, parallel implementation plans and executing them with automated subagent orchestration.

## Installation

Add this plugin to your Claude Code environment:

```bash
/plugin install prd-parallel-execution
```

## Components

### 🎯 PRD-to-Implementation-Plan Skill
Automatically converts PRD documents into optimized implementation plans using a contract-first approach that enables maximum parallel development.

**When it activates**: Use when you have a PRD file and need to break down the work into optimized development streams.

**Features**:
- Contract-first development approach
- 3-phase parallel execution strategy
- API contract prioritization
- Environment setup automation
- 40-60% development time reduction

### ⚡ Execute PRD Plan Command
Orchestrates the execution of PRD implementation plans using parallel subagents for each development stream.

**Usage**:
```bash
/execute-prd-plan path/to/prd.md [project-name]
```

**Features**:
- Automated subagent orchestration
- Parallel execution across development streams
- Dependency management between phases
- Real-time coordination and integration

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Contract & Environment Setup (Day 1-2)
Three parallel streams with zero dependencies:
- **Stream A**: API Contract & Mocking (OpenAPI specs, mock services)
- **Stream B**: Environment & Infrastructure (Docker, databases, auth)
- **Stream C**: Project Scaffolding (CI/CD, tools, structure)

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (Day 2-5)
Three streams that depend on Phase 1 contracts:
- **Stream D**: Backend Implementation (APIs, business logic)
- **Stream E**: Frontend Implementation (UI components, auth UI)
- **Stream F**: Testing Framework (E2E tests, contract testing)

## Example Usage

1. **Convert PRD to Implementation Plan**:
   ```bash
   "Convert this product requirements document into a parallel implementation plan"
   ```

2. **Execute the Full Plan**:
   ```bash
   /execute-prd-plan ./docs/user-management-prd.md user-management-system
   ```

## Key Benefits

- **40-60% Faster Development**: Parallel execution with strategic task organization
- **Contract-First Approach**: API contracts as single source of truth
- **Zero Blocking**: Frontend never waits for backend with mock services
- **Early Testing**: E2E tests developed alongside features
- **Clear Integration Points**: Defined milestones and validation criteria

## Generated Files

The plugin creates comprehensive implementation plans including:
- Detailed task breakdown by development stream
- Dependency mapping and integration points
- Success criteria and validation milestones
- Environment and infrastructure specifications
